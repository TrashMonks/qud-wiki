# qud-wiki
Data extractors for the [official Caves of Qud wiki](https://cavesofqud.gamepedia.com/).  

This project reads game data in the raw format used by the [Caves of Qud](http://www.cavesofqud.com/) roguelike RPG, and contains functionality for updating the entire wiki after a game patch with a few clicks. This project uses Python and Qt via the [PySide2](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python) library, and uses the [mwclient](https://mwclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for Mediawiki functionality.
